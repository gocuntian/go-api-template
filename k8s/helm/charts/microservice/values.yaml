# We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
# choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
# resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
# lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
# resources:
#   limits:
#    cpu: 100m
#    memory: 128Mi
#   requests:
#    cpu: 100m
#    memory: 128Mi
